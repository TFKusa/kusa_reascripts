- The "Toggle" script will now appear at the bottom of the "Customized toolbar" list and on your toolbar. Right click on it's name in the list to customize its position and icon.


        Initial setup :

When setting up for the first time, please click the "Toggle" button a few times, or run the script to initialize it.


        Shorcut assignment :

You can now assign a shortcut to "kusa_AwesomeScriptName - Toggle" for quick access. Additionally, you can assign a shortcut to "kusa_AwesomeScriptName - Main".
This main script will behave differently depending on the toggle state.
