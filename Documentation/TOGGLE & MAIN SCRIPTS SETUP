    TOGGLE & MAIN SCRIPTS SETUP

Some scripts come in two parts :
kusa_AwesomeScriptName - Toggle
kusa_AwesomeScriptName - Main

You need to download both versions to use them as intended.

You can add the "Toggle" script in your toolbar :
- Right click on your toolbar -> Customize toolbar...
- It opens the Customize menus/toolbars window. Click on "Add..." at the bottom left of the window, it will open the Actions windows.
- Look for "kusa_AwesomeScriptName - Toggle", and click on "Select".
- The "Toggle" script now appears at the bottom of the "Customized toolbar" list, and in your toolbar. Right click on it's name to customise its position and icon.


When setting this up for the first time, please click a few times on the "Toggle" button, or run the script to initialize it.

You can now assign a shortcut to "kusa_AwesomeScriptName - Toggle" for quick toggling, and also to "kusa_AwesomeScriptName - Main" that will behave differently depending on the state of the toggle.
